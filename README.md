This project implements Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) analysis using weekly stock data.
It computes risk-adjusted performance measures such as the Sharpe Ratio and Treynor Ratio, and performs CAPM regression for selected stocks relative to the S&P 500 market index.

The analysis is performed on 50 weeks of data (one observation per week), making the project lightweight while still capturing systematic risk relationships.

Stocks analyzed:

Netflix (NFLX)
Navitas (NVTS)

Market proxy:

S&P 500 Index

Risk-free rate:
